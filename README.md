# rbxfpsunlocker-osx-gui

The first Roblox FPS unlocker GUI for macOS. This app works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

This is my first ever swift/swiftUI app, feel free to make a PR to make my code better!

## Features

- Unlock Roblox FPS to display's refresh rate (Metal)
- Unlock Roblox FPS infinitely-*ish* (actually 10000) (Vulkan)
- Native app interface built with modern SwiftUI
- Supports macOS 11.0+
- Revert unlocker at any time
- **Soon:** Auto-install unlocker post-roblox update

## Setup

Since no official build has been released yet, you need to build it yourself. Requires macOS 14.2.1 and Xcode 15.2 or later. Once I polish off the app, I will publish a release.

*Note: you must run the app again when Roblox updates.*

*In the future, I plan to add a auto-install daemon. Not yet though.*

*Note: if you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program** unless you use the Vulkan renderer. Please don't create issues asking about this.*
