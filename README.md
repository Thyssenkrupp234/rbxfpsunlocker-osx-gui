The first Roblox FPS unlocker GUI for macOS. This script works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

Since no official build has been released yet, you need to build it yourself. Requires macOS 14.2.1. Once I polish off the app, I will publish a release.

*Note: you must run the app again when Roblox updates.*

*In the future, I plan to add a auto-install daemon. Not yet though.*

*Note: if you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program** unless you use the Vulkan renderer. Please don't create issues asking about this.*
